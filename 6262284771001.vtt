00:00.440 --> 00:03.390
and the big last quarter coming up here.

00:03.390 --> 00:07.900
But that gap in percentages Is quite significant with the battle for the top four,

00:07.900 --> 00:08.840
well and truly alive.

00:08.850 --> 00:13.720
Got about 12% of that last time against North Melbourne certainly haven't had it all their

00:13.720 --> 00:14.510
own way today.

00:14.510 --> 00:16.850
And one of the reasons has been coming to it out of the middle.

00:17.510 --> 00:18.110
Came through,

00:18.110 --> 00:21.060
couldn't trap and put a tackle on David's unique potentially.

00:21.060 --> 00:23.350
Should have got a free north have the flow of the play.

00:23.350 --> 00:23.870
Anyway,

00:23.880 --> 00:28.480
Zahar fit of the fumbles could still make good with a kick to the

00:28.480 --> 00:29.360
square.

00:30.140 --> 00:34.760
Stevenson denied decisively again by Cordy and it's over and it

00:38.940 --> 00:40.740
another good center about win.

00:40.740 --> 00:45.530
Thereby The Kangaroos are just unable to find a target inside forward.

00:45.540 --> 00:45.990
50

00:50.540 --> 00:52.360
old stone to the outside,

00:53.040 --> 00:56.400
Mcdonald and hanta quickly to Caleb.

00:56.400 --> 00:57.700
Daniel summed it up pretty well.

00:57.700 --> 00:58.190
Got it quickly,

00:58.190 --> 00:59.550
under the boot walker,

00:59.550 --> 01:00.080
rising.

01:00.090 --> 01:01.280
Davies unique vs.

01:01.280 --> 01:06.210
McCray bailey smith is the reinforcements

01:06.210 --> 01:06.850
arrived,

01:06.860 --> 01:10.860
but Huntington wasn't letting him get away and there's money with another clever touch.

01:11.340 --> 01:12.180
Simpkins.

01:13.240 --> 01:13.560
That's right.

01:13.940 --> 01:15.270
Reach a long way for it.

01:15.270 --> 01:16.680
Lucky thomas tackle.

01:16.680 --> 01:19.360
But at the footing has to be a kid from now.

01:21.740 --> 01:22.060
Me.

01:24.440 --> 01:26.620
What should they be looking for next year or over the,

01:26.630 --> 01:28.030
over the trading period?

01:28.040 --> 01:32.450
The kangaroos Johnno specifically just hold fire because thomas hasn't.

01:33.140 --> 01:33.330
Yeah.

01:34.840 --> 01:39.180
And the golden takes a exactly what they need their another another key

01:39.190 --> 01:43.750
forward to work with Lucky thanks who showed some good signs

01:43.750 --> 01:44.750
throughout the year?

01:44.750 --> 01:46.810
Lucky he said,

01:46.810 --> 01:48.060
just to touch is today,

01:48.740 --> 01:49.040
God,

01:49.040 --> 01:50.860
we can come in and put their his second y'all,

01:51.640 --> 01:53.480
which is julie done.

01:53.480 --> 01:58.310
So the kangaroos get the first strike of the last and obviously throwing a bit of kelly at the moment.

01:58.310 --> 01:58.880
I think that's,

01:58.890 --> 02:02.520
I think that's a smart move as well in terms of that depth through the mid food.

02:02.520 --> 02:04.620
You talked about before during the third quarter,

02:05.340 --> 02:07.740
A player like Simkin or babies unique,

02:07.740 --> 02:12.670
They need another class midfielder to jump in there to assist them in their development as

02:12.670 --> 02:14.390
players in the competition as well.

02:14.390 --> 02:18.950
So if they get a couple of those types of players want to keep forward,

02:19.340 --> 02:20.390
another midfielder,

02:20.540 --> 02:24.160
just us that people too well,

02:24.160 --> 02:25.060
that man on screen,

02:25.060 --> 02:25.550
Todd Gold,

02:25.580 --> 02:28.180
he is their best marking forward.

02:28.180 --> 02:28.910
When he goes there,

02:28.920 --> 02:31.350
he's the only one who can take the vertical mark.

02:31.350 --> 02:33.140
There's others that can take it on the league.

02:33.840 --> 02:37.810
So are they better off trying to chase another Robin?

02:37.810 --> 02:42.390
I know they've got a couple of developing Rutman and have Goldstein Finish off his

02:42.390 --> 02:47.360
career as the 2nd Ruckman out of the Gold Square or are they better off

02:47.360 --> 02:51.450
trying to take the long road and develop another gun?

02:51.450 --> 02:52.460
But they're hard to find.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.980
McCray found a way into the footy again.

02:56.240 --> 02:57.100
Davis unique.

02:57.100 --> 03:01.270
They're on the move thomas what he did,

03:01.270 --> 03:03.260
what he had to do started well again here,

03:03.260 --> 03:06.770
North Melbourne though in this quarter and missed their opportunity in the third,

03:06.780 --> 03:11.710
allowed the bulldogs in the last five minutes to break open the game and create the gap in the score

03:11.710 --> 03:11.930
court.

03:11.930 --> 03:16.730
But other than that dame deliberate we're out on the

03:16.730 --> 03:17.060
floor.

03:20.340 --> 03:23.530
So Jason Stevenson The next day,

03:23.530 --> 03:24.760
14 disposals

03:28.840 --> 03:31.450
fine line wasn't so was this kick?

03:33.740 --> 03:37.260
Something hit the post team english,

03:37.260 --> 03:41.160
but it's behind nonetheless area.

03:42.840 --> 03:43.130
Yeah,

03:44.000 --> 03:47.950
That's what actually was that only four experienced over?

03:50.940 --> 03:51.230
Okay,

03:51.230 --> 03:52.390
then here's dale again,

03:52.390 --> 03:55.050
flashing past Bruce.

03:55.540 --> 03:59.830
Couldn't quite now Hall search the kangaroos.

03:59.830 --> 04:03.020
The other ways had to make a few stops along the way.

04:03.020 --> 04:05.050
Aaron hold and he's got a glance deep,

04:05.570 --> 04:07.370
take the kick more than he intended.

04:07.370 --> 04:08.950
Was hoping to connect with thomas,

04:08.960 --> 04:12.030
keith with extra strength and experience got through.

04:12.040 --> 04:15.770
Use the english and then Daniel over the top dog,

04:15.770 --> 04:16.060
speak,

04:16.440 --> 04:19.650
work their way along the wing and Penske fighting it to dale,

04:20.540 --> 04:23.510
forced to pass Mclean just on Taryn thomas,

04:25.240 --> 04:30.160
we all know how good he is inside and what a talent is and hopefully he's going to

04:30.640 --> 04:33.430
display it over a long period of time but he's too often.

04:33.430 --> 04:36.060
I see him fade away and not be inside the game.

04:36.740 --> 04:40.460
And that kick from Hall looked at me as if he had been on the ball,

04:40.570 --> 04:42.980
he can pick that up and market on his chest.

04:43.010 --> 04:43.960
Simkin again,

04:43.960 --> 04:45.360
they all hold their ground,

04:45.370 --> 04:50.260
Stevenson came to the footy thomas does activate this time and they should go.

04:50.840 --> 04:54.800
Uh huh McClarty,

04:54.980 --> 04:56.960
it's been a forgettable day for the big fella.

04:57.210 --> 05:00.250
Only three disposals for Lockie in today's game

05:09.040 --> 05:11.460
one goal 2 for the quarter so far for north,

05:11.940 --> 05:13.350
nothing for the bulldogs

05:17.540 --> 05:18.160
purse.

05:18.840 --> 05:23.550
Tried to fend so off Jamal but not stable force the turnover and then

05:24.760 --> 05:25.310
did you arrest?

05:25.310 --> 05:28.960
Has kicked it out on the floor and now he hurt himself in the process.

05:29.830 --> 05:30.460
The pants off,

05:31.740 --> 05:32.880
it's just hard to miss them.

05:32.880 --> 05:34.950
Kick the girls hockey.

05:35.640 --> 05:35.840
Yeah,

05:36.840 --> 05:37.160
yeah,

05:37.940 --> 05:40.460
bailey smith had a big game last week.

05:41.340 --> 05:42.570
quite as much of the 40 today.

05:42.570 --> 05:44.580
14 touches for the doggies,

05:44.580 --> 05:46.050
taran back to the middle,

05:46.840 --> 05:49.150
counting to lose everywhere.

05:50.440 --> 05:51.320
Just sim card.

05:51.320 --> 05:54.960
He's got run from beside and behind Aaron Hall,

05:54.960 --> 05:55.720
the platform,

05:55.720 --> 05:56.560
He's had a bounce,

05:56.560 --> 05:58.650
he's got a long blasted gold.

05:59.340 --> 06:04.050
It's another miss for the kangaroos On three for the term

06:05.240 --> 06:06.280
And hold up to 24.

06:06.280 --> 06:06.910
Disposes,

06:06.910 --> 06:07.660
Bailey Dale.

06:09.700 --> 06:11.260
The hamburger bailey Williams

06:14.160 --> 06:15.970
normally is riding with the footy.

06:15.970 --> 06:17.690
Not that time coming to the laki,

06:17.690 --> 06:20.150
maybe this time you can make them pass.

06:22.940 --> 06:23.870
Well that's a rarity.

06:23.880 --> 06:27.460
You don't see the dogs dropped the ball up like that too often

06:29.540 --> 06:30.620
in six minutes though.

06:30.620 --> 06:31.930
They've had seven inside fifties.

06:31.930 --> 06:33.080
20 North Melbourne,

06:33.080 --> 06:33.520
one goal,

06:33.520 --> 06:34.360
three on the board.

06:34.360 --> 06:37.060
So absolutely dominating at the moment.

06:38.240 --> 06:38.440
Yeah.

06:39.540 --> 06:41.730
Anything nick clarkie.

06:43.140 --> 06:44.360
His first goal.

06:44.740 --> 06:44.950
Mhm.

06:45.340 --> 06:46.230
Doesn't get any better.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.460
It's behind

06:51.640 --> 06:52.750
coach tries to stay.

06:52.760 --> 06:53.160
Can

07:00.340 --> 07:00.530
yeah,

07:01.340 --> 07:06.260
five scoring shots from seven inside 50 and

07:06.260 --> 07:08.660
bulldogs try again short to bunt and pellet.

07:16.340 --> 07:17.260
I am a crate.

07:25.640 --> 07:26.730
Thanks at the Bruce.

07:26.730 --> 07:27.540
You got to the front,

07:27.540 --> 07:28.760
but Goldstein does enough.

07:29.340 --> 07:29.550
Well,

07:29.550 --> 07:33.280
they're broken down across the wing probably four or five times in a row now,

07:33.280 --> 07:33.600
johnny,

07:33.600 --> 07:35.850
which is unlike the Western bulldogs.

07:36.940 --> 07:38.840
Much better defense by the kangaroos.

07:40.040 --> 07:41.600
They're just pumping it down the line,

07:41.950 --> 07:43.960
not crossing as much as they normally do

07:51.040 --> 07:51.650
english.

07:51.660 --> 07:56.490
Goldstein almost fell over himself and his

07:56.490 --> 08:00.970
keepers smuggling battles within the battle timmy just

08:00.980 --> 08:04.750
gets the accolades from his teammates for that desperate smaller

08:07.640 --> 08:11.260
and his role may change again in the coming weeks teeming with steve martin

08:12.340 --> 08:15.550
looking to make a return for the bulldogs.

08:17.140 --> 08:21.030
Kray go a second time thomas got himself onto the foot of that time.

08:21.030 --> 08:21.930
Jamal to haul,

08:21.940 --> 08:25.410
he keeps running and giving them something out of defense,

08:25.840 --> 08:28.560
tuck the kick away for sherry challenged again by Cordy,

08:29.340 --> 08:34.000
I've got to get the hand balled out to scott let this pressure bali Williams dives on it.

08:34.010 --> 08:37.380
He knew is that now he's dragged it in again but good awareness

08:39.040 --> 08:43.300
opportunity is still there for the kangaroos just got away from Curtis taylor

08:43.530 --> 08:48.510
lucky eventually does give you seemed reluctant to give it to

08:48.510 --> 08:53.410
turn it and another behind this one girl five for the court

08:53.620 --> 08:54.460
in that passage of play,

08:54.460 --> 08:57.070
money was involved again for North Melbourne,

08:57.070 --> 09:01.470
Jack marty and he's been extremely clean in terms of

09:01.480 --> 09:03.320
that below his knees.

09:03.320 --> 09:06.510
The ground ball Inside Forward 50 for North Melbourne.

09:06.510 --> 09:10.500
He set up a couple of opportunities this evening for the cameras.

09:10.500 --> 09:13.360
They just haven't been able to finish that last kick.

09:13.360 --> 09:15.550
Now those opportunities one goal five in this quarter,

09:15.550 --> 09:20.070
Hutto cry now

09:20.070 --> 09:20.760
Lipinsky.

09:22.940 --> 09:23.150
Mhm.

09:23.540 --> 09:27.190
Gets away from Bronson Pelly tomorrow got some protection.

09:27.190 --> 09:28.360
The book wasn't out of it.

09:28.370 --> 09:32.670
Fantastic tackle is driven with the footage first pleasant forward.

09:32.680 --> 09:34.360
Tarrant ward from Garcia.

09:35.040 --> 09:36.540
Mhm Yeah.

09:36.940 --> 09:38.460
And eventually got the free kick

09:42.940 --> 09:44.920
paul again it was a bullet to thomas.

09:44.940 --> 09:48.550
Sure it was made for thomas was a bit sharper than him and he intended

09:55.140 --> 09:56.460
being slow just for a moment,

09:57.040 --> 10:01.160
Philips gathered back thomas kept on coming

10:01.940 --> 10:02.870
out to Tyler,

10:05.240 --> 10:07.250
that is your back down the line on the one on one,

10:08.440 --> 10:10.350
Being watched by two right playing.

10:12.740 --> 10:14.230
So how was shaping as well?

10:14.230 --> 10:15.950
But he plays it inside to Marnie,

10:17.440 --> 10:21.930
back to the outside so well worked worked and what they've been able to do the bulldogs applying,

10:22.260 --> 10:27.000
they're retreating a lot instead of the bulldogs when they're at their very best,

10:27.000 --> 10:29.850
they come up and man the market in tandoor,

10:29.850 --> 10:31.450
put frontal pressure on at the moment,

10:31.460 --> 10:36.230
just retreating with the amount of all that North Melbourne are gathering in this last

10:36.230 --> 10:38.750
quarter and they've been able to be opened up a little bit.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.040
Someone needs to step up and kick strike for the kangaroos.

10:44.040 --> 10:45.050
This is not easy,

10:45.920 --> 10:47.750
but that's how you do it,

10:49.970 --> 10:52.160
kim zohar enjoyed it.

10:53.140 --> 10:57.740
That's so he's sure the kangaroos nine times into the 50 in this last

10:57.740 --> 10:58.160
quarter,

10:58.540 --> 11:00.050
eventually get some reward,

11:00.060 --> 11:00.640
two goals,

11:00.650 --> 11:00.990
5,

11:00.990 --> 11:05.950
it's been Total domination in terms of where the foot has been played and

11:06.190 --> 11:09.000
the door is just a jar at 22 points.

11:09.440 --> 11:10.460
Dogs better wake up.

11:11.240 --> 11:11.390
Yeah,

11:11.390 --> 11:15.170
I think that's a fair comment can be sucked in by thinking this is by design.

11:15.170 --> 11:17.860
The Western bulldogs are just going into defensive mode,

11:18.340 --> 11:23.080
but they've just taken the foot off psychologically and

11:23.090 --> 11:24.150
physically.

11:24.740 --> 11:29.650
And the kangaroos are hanging in there when they could be well and truly

11:30.140 --> 11:32.660
a bit closer given that they kicked two goals five,

11:32.670 --> 11:33.560
they get the next one.

11:33.570 --> 11:38.510
All of a sudden they're going to start thinking they've got a chance to win this nine

11:38.510 --> 11:40.660
inside fifties there they are there in the last 10,

11:40.670 --> 11:44.960
all the kangaroos but nine in this Quarter for seven shots at goal

11:46.140 --> 11:47.760
three girls for came too hot.

11:48.260 --> 11:50.450
This purple patch continues.

11:52.940 --> 11:57.250
You've got Cody Weightman sitting down there in the gold square is on four goals.

11:57.260 --> 11:59.650
He wants his first five for there's a bag,

11:59.660 --> 12:02.070
there's incentive there and the ball hasn't gone inside.

12:02.070 --> 12:07.000
The 4 50 young data Ponton Pelly smith and

12:07.000 --> 12:09.850
they do just get it inside the arc for how long.

12:11.640 --> 12:13.590
So now sign a couple desperate handballs.

12:13.590 --> 12:16.050
The last from Wallace in the back.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.150
It's a rich Wallace.

12:20.140 --> 12:20.850
Yeah,

12:24.540 --> 12:24.740
yeah.

12:26.140 --> 12:27.230
As we mentioned earlier,

12:27.280 --> 12:32.090
the first two rounds of the year and then The last two sub got on

12:32.090 --> 12:32.950
both times.

12:34.840 --> 12:35.050
Yes,

12:35.540 --> 12:37.810
opportunity for his first goal of the season,

12:37.810 --> 12:38.480
mitch Wallis

12:44.710 --> 12:45.800
Skips to the 50,

12:45.800 --> 12:46.940
gets a little closer,

12:47.300 --> 12:51.850
he's got plenty on it and that will be a popular goal for the Western Bulldogs,

12:51.850 --> 12:53.320
fans and players alike.

12:54.840 --> 12:55.050
Okay,

12:55.740 --> 12:59.760
been a tough season for mitch Wallis for the vice captain delivers a goal

13:00.540 --> 13:01.950
A timely one at that.

13:02.540 --> 13:06.150
He was roundly celebrate advice to Metz spot on Hutto.

13:06.150 --> 13:10.920
It's timely because the head of the light scoring so far in

13:10.920 --> 13:15.500
this quarter and just their hall just into the back of Wallace there,

13:15.500 --> 13:16.260
away again,

13:17.540 --> 13:18.350
North Melbourne.

13:19.110 --> 13:20.080
He just falls,

13:20.100 --> 13:23.940
did roll a little bit so you can see a little bit unlucky there,

13:24.230 --> 13:26.050
erin whole North Bellmore away again.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.440
That's an excellent finish from meet Wallace.

13:29.940 --> 13:34.680
What is the advantage of the stand rule got the momentum he required good launch from just outside

13:34.690 --> 13:35.160
50.

13:36.340 --> 13:39.000
That was good use of the stand role in the band the mark,

13:39.000 --> 13:39.550
wasn't it?

13:39.940 --> 13:41.640
You said a lot of players get it wrong,

13:41.650 --> 13:42.360
get it wrong.

13:47.540 --> 13:51.950
Sets back to 28 Sherry laboratory in a flash

13:53.740 --> 13:54.430
jets.

13:54.580 --> 13:55.660
The incoming ball.

13:56.040 --> 13:58.310
The whole played well played it quickly.

13:58.320 --> 14:03.060
David is unique and into Marnie direct path this time

14:03.440 --> 14:07.850
and from the side he's got it again on the one hand at this time,

14:08.440 --> 14:10.240
he is chock full of confidence.

14:10.250 --> 14:15.060
I was just about to say exactly that because that was the confidence when he

14:15.060 --> 14:17.210
actually tapped it with the one hand then landed.

14:17.410 --> 14:18.690
And then the body language is like,

14:18.700 --> 14:19.110
yeah,

14:19.160 --> 14:19.770
struck,

14:20.040 --> 14:21.260
I'm feeling good at the moment.

14:21.260 --> 14:24.260
Strap factor they go,

14:24.940 --> 14:26.050
that's a great mark.

14:27.340 --> 14:29.340
It's just showing everything he's got,

14:29.350 --> 14:30.460
he's got himself fitter.

14:34.140 --> 14:34.860
That is,

14:35.340 --> 14:35.540
yeah.

14:36.040 --> 14:37.450
Got himself for

14:40.740 --> 14:42.310
not quite the same,

14:42.320 --> 14:46.880
struck with the cake quite as convincing but through it goes

14:51.230 --> 14:55.550
And again they get to it in 22 points and he just,

14:55.560 --> 14:58.760
he just works straight back to the ball and you can see his man,

14:59.740 --> 15:02.620
Williams was playing aggressively out the front.

15:02.620 --> 15:07.550
He didn't have any contemplation that his man was going to push

15:07.560 --> 15:12.510
back and be inside that contest and he takes a one hander just

15:12.510 --> 15:13.370
to give them a chance.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.550
Just a little change.

15:15.940 --> 15:16.180
Well,

15:16.180 --> 15:17.270
they've been good in this area.

15:17.270 --> 15:18.010
Said about

15:26.740 --> 15:31.450
so two bags of four in the game from weightman and Zahara

15:34.140 --> 15:35.760
a very different scenario.

15:35.770 --> 15:39.080
So when these two sides met in round three and out of the middle they go again,

15:39.420 --> 15:41.300
Stevenson curls are deep.

15:41.310 --> 15:46.290
This time Lucky gets in on the act and suddenly there's

15:46.290 --> 15:51.280
a bit of urgency and maybe a bit of belief and normally he

15:51.280 --> 15:56.130
is a beautiful kids Miss one on the run and in a rush and then the

15:56.130 --> 15:57.460
set shot that missed as well.

15:58.040 --> 15:58.970
Another city clear.

15:58.970 --> 16:01.550
It's from kangaroos.

16:05.240 --> 16:05.560
Mhm.

16:08.940 --> 16:10.860
To carry it back to 16.

16:18.940 --> 16:22.750
Mhm mhm

16:23.240 --> 16:25.360
36 in his last quarter,

16:27.540 --> 16:31.750
you're right mm.

16:34.870 --> 16:37.070
If a hanan walker should have the advantage,

16:37.080 --> 16:41.800
probably pushed it in the back and then

16:42.640 --> 16:43.530
Maybe feeling guilty,

16:43.540 --> 16:44.470
Kicks it out on the 4th.

16:45.540 --> 16:46.170
Two goals,

16:46.170 --> 16:49.560
seven kangaroos have kicked from stoppage Western bulldogs,

16:49.560 --> 16:54.480
five goals through send about since the dogs to to

16:54.530 --> 16:59.510
North Melbourne 13 after getting away to a start and that leads

16:59.510 --> 17:00.590
all the way through to Bruce.

17:00.590 --> 17:05.450
You handed off to a man who is under the pump immediately and Garcia turn right on the

17:05.460 --> 17:05.790
job,

17:05.790 --> 17:09.760
hanging on right.

17:10.740 --> 17:15.220
I haven't really been to take advantage of some of the dynamic play from the stoppage.

17:15.230 --> 17:15.900
North Melbourne,

17:20.640 --> 17:22.430
you have urgency in the bulldogs box

17:28.140 --> 17:29.910
bit of a lift on smith from Canning town,

17:29.910 --> 17:34.780
such a testament to restrict their beverages asked during the

17:34.780 --> 17:39.360
week about whether that's resting players and managing players and he said no,

17:39.840 --> 17:41.460
certainly wasn't in the plans.

17:42.640 --> 17:47.190
Hunter applies it to half forward and you made a wacky

17:47.200 --> 17:51.800
races and elegy about who's going to be in front of the end just before martin

17:51.800 --> 17:53.700
Jared Penelope pit stuff.

17:53.710 --> 17:54.860
She was always a favorite

18:00.140 --> 18:01.550
21 points at the month.

18:03.740 --> 18:08.170
English thomas draped an arm over his shoulder,

18:11.170 --> 18:12.550
his foot a little bit earlier in the game.

18:12.550 --> 18:15.170
Got some treatment been in there,

18:17.140 --> 18:18.780
plays the part there into scott,

18:18.790 --> 18:20.050
brings it to Stevenson.

18:21.040 --> 18:22.190
Just slip for a moment.

18:22.190 --> 18:23.270
Got himself balanced,

18:23.280 --> 18:24.270
gets a date.

18:24.740 --> 18:26.100
Zoo has cabin.

18:26.460 --> 18:29.770
Oh and he wasn't far off well that but okay.

18:31.840 --> 18:35.220
I would have eventually find their way through scott back to the wing,

18:35.400 --> 18:37.770
nicely judged by white men.

18:39.040 --> 18:41.030
Bruce has got through in his way,

18:41.030 --> 18:43.660
so reluctant to kick it along to him.

18:43.660 --> 18:44.380
He does in the end.

18:44.380 --> 18:45.010
Anyway,

18:45.020 --> 18:47.440
hand will help out props at the front,

18:47.440 --> 18:48.460
takes an excellent,

18:48.670 --> 18:50.050
excellent work from,

18:50.640 --> 18:55.580
from Hannah and he was open in the middle of the ground as weightman took the mark and they

18:55.590 --> 18:56.860
continue to push forward,

18:57.920 --> 18:59.180
he put himself in a position.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.550
One thought I thought he was going to get from the square of the contest.

19:02.550 --> 19:03.670
With Bruce coming out,

19:04.340 --> 19:05.800
turned his body nicely.

19:06.940 --> 19:08.680
It's a great contestant market from Henan,

19:08.890 --> 19:12.270
which drink from the contest deserved it after working hard

19:13.640 --> 19:16.960
nine disposals and the girl so far for the afternoon

19:22.940 --> 19:25.670
with the right at home with mitch Hannah never online.

19:27.740 --> 19:30.950
That's the bulldogs turn to be a little strike

19:35.340 --> 19:36.170
thomas coverage,

19:37.240 --> 19:38.740
plenty of territory at the moment.

19:38.810 --> 19:39.990
Back there with Hall,

19:40.720 --> 19:45.560
it was to sink in career had some possibilities through the middle of an

19:45.560 --> 19:48.080
entirely time to fall over from Mcdonald.

19:48.090 --> 19:49.740
Weightman tried to sum it up,

19:49.750 --> 19:51.080
he had two choices.

19:51.510 --> 19:56.460
We just kicked in the direction of the curly hair he was hanging on Wallace

19:56.860 --> 19:59.950
and Wallace takes the market and over the top.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.400
It was the moment.

20:01.400 --> 20:01.840
Mr,

20:01.890 --> 20:02.860
it was on.

20:02.860 --> 20:03.460
Not on.

20:05.740 --> 20:05.920
Well,

20:05.920 --> 20:07.270
erin Hall was lingering.

20:09.140 --> 20:10.700
I'm not sure whether we would have got there,

20:10.710 --> 20:14.860
but I think he could have released the handle

20:15.520 --> 20:15.950
there.

20:17.940 --> 20:20.280
Wallace Boston three for a

20:20.280 --> 20:25.240
second but that's what he does

20:25.240 --> 20:27.870
have that superior confidence in front of the sticks,

20:28.110 --> 20:32.190
which Wallace so took it upon himself to go back.

20:32.200 --> 20:36.900
Now the set shot just settle things down here for the bulldogs in the last

20:36.900 --> 20:37.290
quarter,

20:37.290 --> 20:40.530
off the back of Mcdonald's slipping over it was the china,

20:41.040 --> 20:43.780
I think the kick was on the kid wasn't the kid was behind him a little bit.

20:43.780 --> 20:46.570
That's why that's why he slipped otherwise.

20:46.570 --> 20:49.300
If the kid was the kick was perfect as you can see there,

20:50.300 --> 20:51.780
if he hits that right luke,

20:51.780 --> 20:54.170
Mcdonald just takes that mark and away they go.

20:55.140 --> 20:59.450
So you think mitch Morris is going to be in there Finals 22,

20:59.460 --> 20:59.650
you know,

20:59.650 --> 21:03.250
it depends on injuries and there's a couple of months to go,

21:03.260 --> 21:06.850
but he's going to be in that is in the 25-6 in the squad.

21:07.840 --> 21:12.050
So then it comes down to injury and just his fall As to whether each other

21:12.220 --> 21:14.190
22 you're playing.

21:14.200 --> 21:17.120
That's right next coach.

21:18.650 --> 21:20.930
Just taking a week at a time,

21:21.930 --> 21:24.340
Simkin gets it to center half forward.

21:24.340 --> 21:25.010
Lucky,

21:25.840 --> 21:27.830
suddenly looking more likely down there.

21:29.440 --> 21:30.200
Mcdonald,

21:30.210 --> 21:35.050
Hannah working well at both ends phillips at all.

21:35.810 --> 21:36.450
Lucky,

21:36.460 --> 21:37.960
that was a real opportunity.

21:38.340 --> 21:40.260
His grasp with a huge debate.

21:42.140 --> 21:43.640
Walk it Thomas again,

21:43.640 --> 21:45.180
they can wind up one more time.

21:45.190 --> 21:49.680
I got a call from David's unique and he takes the mark on the periphery of the 50,

21:49.690 --> 21:51.390
puts it wide for Taylor.

21:51.990 --> 21:53.960
He stands his ground and takes the mark.

21:55.940 --> 21:56.170
Yeah.

22:00.340 --> 22:00.550
Mhm.

22:08.570 --> 22:11.150
Directly getting into the midterms possession wise,

22:11.400 --> 22:14.090
Curtis taylor Right now,

22:14.100 --> 22:14.850
he has to do it.

22:15.240 --> 22:18.660
Few of his other teammates have been able to do late in this game and that's kick straight.

22:28.840 --> 22:30.900
The other question mark for the bulldogs in the forward line.

22:30.900 --> 22:31.500
I reckon Mick,

22:31.500 --> 22:33.890
Channon he's been in and out a couple of times,

22:33.900 --> 22:35.960
john hasn't got a bag please.

22:37.040 --> 22:38.860
four goals up until today.

22:40.540 --> 22:42.320
He certainly has a nail the spot.

22:42.330 --> 22:45.230
There's always players on the periphery.

22:45.230 --> 22:49.880
Sometimes they get lucky and others don't just joined us.

22:49.890 --> 22:52.920
Erin Norton for the second time In the last three weeks,

22:52.920 --> 22:54.170
stepped off at halftime.

22:55.740 --> 22:57.180
A song with concussion.

22:57.210 --> 22:58.340
I think it's fun to power.

22:58.340 --> 23:03.170
He sends it to burst and that's mm back

23:05.000 --> 23:06.920
there he is there to play the swans next week,

23:06.930 --> 23:11.190
which is going to be a heck of a match given the swans form in recent times,

23:11.200 --> 23:12.620
narrow loss to Port Adelaide.

23:12.620 --> 23:15.960
Then a massive win at the home ground down at G M H.

23:15.960 --> 23:16.160
B.

23:16.160 --> 23:19.550
A walker threads it through.

23:20.940 --> 23:24.730
I'm pretty sure I know West Coast fixed the review requests for next year.

23:24.730 --> 23:25.910
There will be no games in july

23:29.640 --> 23:31.670
five and a little to go.

23:33.540 --> 23:35.710
Some Melbourne based clubs might sell their home games.

23:35.710 --> 23:39.360
The team may be able to play the West Coast eagles.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.750
So while the bulldogs have activated this up,

23:45.830 --> 23:50.550
Eddie Ford hasn't got any time as the kangaroos suck.

23:50.560 --> 23:55.350
It just seemed a little of the decision to if someone had a boo and make them to sub

23:55.360 --> 23:55.760
Jonah.

23:56.340 --> 23:57.660
I'm not a fan of that at all.

23:58.940 --> 23:59.170
What?

23:59.940 --> 24:01.440
So the hawks do it in round one.

24:02.340 --> 24:04.560
A lot of discussion around at that time as well,

24:05.340 --> 24:08.160
should be a rule around it.

24:08.640 --> 24:10.160
I know plenty of rules in the game,

24:10.160 --> 24:11.060
but let's have another one.

24:12.940 --> 24:16.360
Johannesson blasted long or Bruce from the side.

24:16.370 --> 24:19.960
Young taking a spectacular mark,

24:20.540 --> 24:22.270
josh Bruce thought he got pushed.

24:24.240 --> 24:25.010
Did the umpire,

24:25.020 --> 24:26.220
He might have paid the free kick,

24:26.220 --> 24:26.550
did it?

24:26.800 --> 24:26.990
No,

24:26.990 --> 24:31.060
I think you paid the mark mark and it was a great one as well.

24:31.060 --> 24:31.490
You're right.

24:31.490 --> 24:33.360
He said a good second half.

24:34.140 --> 24:34.750
Young.

24:34.760 --> 24:36.150
Just tell you some big crabs,

24:36.150 --> 24:36.560
look at that.

24:37.040 --> 24:37.670
Oh yeah.

24:37.680 --> 24:39.460
Just keeps his leg underneath as well.

24:39.940 --> 24:42.030
Walkers come over the injury as well,

24:42.040 --> 24:43.150
Bruce has got the ball.

24:43.940 --> 24:44.310
Oh,

24:44.310 --> 24:44.690
there you go.

24:44.690 --> 24:45.530
So sorry.

24:45.660 --> 24:46.180
No,

24:46.720 --> 24:47.300
that's fine.

24:47.310 --> 24:49.160
I thought I heard the umpire say Mark,

24:51.140 --> 24:53.350
there's a problem with Joshua.

24:53.840 --> 24:54.670
Just water.

24:55.440 --> 24:55.670
Mhm,

24:58.440 --> 24:58.670
mhm.

24:59.440 --> 25:00.780
So Young robbed at the tents,

25:00.780 --> 25:02.360
Get his first goal in the footage.

25:02.370 --> 25:03.460
We want to see that.

25:04.240 --> 25:08.620
And instead of josh Bruce just had a quiet compared to

25:08.620 --> 25:10.800
expectations for his third.

25:12.640 --> 25:12.990
Well,

25:13.000 --> 25:15.280
he has kicked the ball sublimely this year.

25:15.290 --> 25:16.610
And that's the old josh Bruce.

25:16.610 --> 25:18.770
A little bit of a break in the knee,

25:18.770 --> 25:19.860
A little bit of a poke

25:23.740 --> 25:27.880
Zabel down the Grand Tyler could have Covington.

25:27.880 --> 25:29.550
That was disappointing for it.

25:30.440 --> 25:31.270
I want to share it.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.510
Another big guy from county to the out.

25:33.520 --> 25:35.950
It's been great tomorrow.

25:37.440 --> 25:38.180
So once again,

25:38.180 --> 25:41.080
when that kid tougher like he wasn't like,

25:41.080 --> 25:42.770
he's gotta work though and you can't,

25:43.140 --> 25:48.100
You can't expect him to kick at 60 m over the top of his head so he's either got to get in front or he doesn't

25:48.100 --> 25:48.960
get the ball kicked at him.

25:49.440 --> 25:50.270
It's great defense,

25:50.370 --> 25:55.300
straight lines on the way out and then young's recovered but stable putting

25:55.300 --> 26:00.040
for the crunch hanan date for Bruce one more time

26:00.050 --> 26:03.030
he's got a free advantage.

26:03.310 --> 26:04.020
Mcrae,

26:04.070 --> 26:06.000
Wallace might get his third go,

26:06.010 --> 26:10.990
a little bonus for the doggies and For mitch Wallis

26:13.040 --> 26:13.760
the Lebanese,

26:14.640 --> 26:15.810
the white man and Wallace

26:20.640 --> 26:21.560
leading the way in.

26:22.140 --> 26:23.850
Both have been charged for the Borders

26:31.570 --> 26:34.640
Wallace three goals today.

26:34.650 --> 26:36.320
So he's kicked three in the last quarter.

26:36.500 --> 26:41.390
Came through in the first quarter finish the game strongly mitch Wallis and the day

26:41.390 --> 26:43.100
in some ways from all,

26:43.100 --> 26:45.370
stein is for Talaja right,

26:46.540 --> 26:50.960
Premiership Player with the Hawks Grand Final There in 2014

26:53.640 --> 26:55.560
superstars there and look at them all,

26:57.340 --> 26:59.170
repeated the dose in 2015.

26:59.180 --> 27:04.100
Right I mentioned earlier this will be the 7th Year out of his nine seasons.

27:04.100 --> 27:05.110
He'll play finals footing.

27:06.040 --> 27:10.060
He found his form again a couple years ago and then last year was quiet

27:11.740 --> 27:15.060
and then he's well and truly back to his very best.

27:15.440 --> 27:15.900
The challenge.

27:15.900 --> 27:16.160
Right?

27:22.740 --> 27:27.690
Mhm three minutes left time for bunch of Pelli a gift

27:27.700 --> 27:30.960
to liberate or right and out in front of Mclean

27:32.240 --> 27:32.860
Young.

27:33.940 --> 27:34.800
He went for it.

27:34.800 --> 27:38.050
I think chris first car football,

27:38.540 --> 27:43.140
a lot of science goes into center bounces and it's interesting just to compare the two

27:43.150 --> 27:43.620
clubs,

27:44.340 --> 27:49.150
Western bulldogs line everybody up in a straight line 15 m also

27:49.150 --> 27:50.670
apart at the other end of the ground,

27:50.670 --> 27:52.210
it's a 32 and one set up,

27:52.210 --> 27:55.960
three up on the line to midway and one in the square my own.

27:56.940 --> 27:58.560
Which did you prefer?

27:58.940 --> 27:59.270
Oh,

27:59.740 --> 28:00.360
everyone up,

28:01.140 --> 28:03.370
everyone up just like you and the girls.

28:04.340 --> 28:06.330
So now I like that.

28:06.340 --> 28:11.290
I do like the line out in some ways because you go either way because because you're midfielders have got left

28:11.290 --> 28:12.140
and right foot is in there.

28:12.140 --> 28:12.980
So whoever comes out,

28:12.980 --> 28:13.580
you can break,

28:13.590 --> 28:17.960
you can break either side on the foot of the preferred foot of the midfielder coming out,

28:18.440 --> 28:23.310
got over the Rockman there and then grinds to a halt and that's and that's the biggest

28:23.310 --> 28:23.500
trigger.

28:23.500 --> 28:27.760
That's that's all you got to understand the most is what midfielder you've got coming out.

28:28.640 --> 28:29.770
If that's in advance,

28:31.040 --> 28:32.960
whatever he wants to get a third,

28:34.540 --> 28:35.820
it wasn't too far away.

28:37.040 --> 28:38.190
So with the western bulldogs,

28:38.190 --> 28:42.230
you generally get to one side because they've got Mcrae laboratory had bombed in there,

28:42.230 --> 28:45.030
that left leg consistently coming coming out of there.

28:45.030 --> 28:49.380
So you want to open up that side of ground almost gifted another chance

28:50.240 --> 28:55.060
trying to get through to Hannon Wallace

28:55.640 --> 28:56.960
maclean.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.580
So the dog is turned to blow a few.

29:00.580 --> 29:02.950
It's been an inaccurate quarter collectively.

29:03.260 --> 29:04.360
Six goals,

29:04.740 --> 29:05.460
11,

29:07.940 --> 29:08.240
3,

29:08.240 --> 29:08.660
7,

29:08.670 --> 29:08.960
3,

29:08.960 --> 29:09.360
4.

29:10.040 --> 29:10.270
Yeah.

29:13.540 --> 29:18.360
Ehrenhalt trots back in one of the big diet with his numbers

29:19.240 --> 29:20.310
kicking.

29:20.310 --> 29:21.670
It always helps of course.

29:22.440 --> 29:26.560
31 Despises for Hall Mcdonald

29:28.340 --> 29:32.860
sink in Carrington who still

29:33.640 --> 29:34.960
working right to the end.

29:38.140 --> 29:38.830
Unfortunately,

29:38.830 --> 29:40.110
radar a little off that time.

29:40.110 --> 29:41.920
Another behind for the kangaroos.

29:41.930 --> 29:42.850
So Jonah,

29:43.340 --> 29:44.940
if it was picked right now,

29:44.950 --> 29:46.060
the Australian side.

29:47.340 --> 29:52.070
How many players from the dogs would be in contention is the next four for

29:52.070 --> 29:52.430
north.

29:52.430 --> 29:53.340
While you ponder that,

29:53.340 --> 29:55.320
Johnno while there's a few,

29:55.320 --> 29:55.660
isn't there?

29:55.660 --> 30:00.050
You've probably got four I think in terms of McCray bottom Pelly dale.

30:00.440 --> 30:02.050
Maybe keith as well.

30:02.640 --> 30:02.970
Okay.

30:05.740 --> 30:07.310
And then I get another light shot for girl.

30:07.310 --> 30:08.810
This time it's Taryn thomas,

30:08.930 --> 30:09.670
drinks tackle.

30:12.140 --> 30:14.700
Do you think Keith in the 20 tour in the squad in the squad

30:17.440 --> 30:21.700
21 thomas

30:23.040 --> 30:26.060
Coming in for position 24 for the day.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.280
The 11th disposal.

30:32.280 --> 30:35.960
The final turn as one of his best

30:40.240 --> 30:42.720
Have had 12 scoring shots in the last quarter.

30:42.720 --> 30:45.060
The Kangaroos four girls eight.

30:45.640 --> 30:47.620
The margin is back to 29 points.

30:47.710 --> 30:50.760
That's a big finish for you.

30:50.760 --> 30:51.500
Sit here and you go,

30:51.510 --> 30:51.940
you know what,

30:51.940 --> 30:53.540
they've been okay today again,

30:53.950 --> 30:58.690
they just haven't had the class to finish or they missed their own opportunities in front of

30:58.700 --> 30:58.990
goal,

30:58.990 --> 31:02.410
especially in this third quarter and in this last quarter.

31:02.410 --> 31:05.270
So the gap could have been a lot closer from the North Melbourne,

31:05.740 --> 31:06.700
the point of view,

31:06.750 --> 31:09.840
but overall the way they've been able to work through the four quarters,

31:09.840 --> 31:13.750
the adjustment in the game from when they played in three now significant.

31:13.890 --> 31:16.170
And you can see that in the growth of where they're going,

31:17.840 --> 31:19.080
there's their next four,

31:19.090 --> 31:23.830
who knows what in the West coast will put out next week.

31:23.830 --> 31:26.450
So that's a gettable game given their recent form,

31:26.840 --> 31:28.740
essen and Carlton and get along.

31:28.740 --> 31:33.730
So it's a good test to see whether over the next month mentioned the contrast of

31:33.730 --> 31:34.700
the game earlier in the year.

31:34.700 --> 31:36.560
The bollocks kicked 10 goals,

31:36.560 --> 31:37.720
7 to 2 goals,

31:37.720 --> 31:38.890
one in the last quarter,

31:39.440 --> 31:40.550
Back in Round three.

31:41.440 --> 31:46.080
This time the kangaroos whose last quarter's haven't been great over the year Looking like they're gonna win the

31:46.080 --> 31:47.870
corner 38 seconds left,

31:47.870 --> 31:52.120
lipinski and the guilty look on his face.

31:52.540 --> 31:54.080
He's paying for holding the ball.

31:54.100 --> 31:54.800
Covington.

31:55.090 --> 31:58.350
Covington's had four shots of gold A two goals to yes,

32:00.140 --> 32:03.440
the dogs got in each other's wide Baillie scott with another opportunity.

32:03.450 --> 32:08.030
Wanted desperately to share it With zero Ho is ready and waiting and in the

32:08.040 --> 32:09.460
process he lost a handle.

32:10.340 --> 32:10.580
Yeah,

32:10.580 --> 32:11.580
you want to give the handball.

32:11.580 --> 32:16.330
Then he thought about coming back inside and I think the next level for development for this kid is just to

32:16.330 --> 32:18.950
understand how good he can be and own it.

32:19.640 --> 32:20.360
I agree with that.

32:21.140 --> 32:25.670
Goldstein one Last gas perhaps scott

32:26.140 --> 32:27.160
clearing kick.

32:28.240 --> 32:28.560
Yeah,

32:29.740 --> 32:34.620
down Carl Daniel back

32:34.620 --> 32:36.300
into the middle siren.

32:36.300 --> 32:37.500
About to sound.

32:38.170 --> 32:39.760
They had to work all day.

32:40.060 --> 32:42.690
But at the completion of around 16,

32:42.700 --> 32:46.050
the Western Bulldogs are on top of the ladder.

32:49.440 --> 32:49.670
Yeah.

32:59.640 --> 33:00.060
Mhm.

33:00.940 --> 33:05.740
And a great winner was to the Western bulldogs because they were really challenged today by the kangaroos.

33:05.750 --> 33:07.220
Down on class.

33:07.220 --> 33:09.260
The kangaroos down on a couple of players.

33:10.240 --> 33:12.490
We will see them jump significantly up the ladder,

33:12.490 --> 33:17.420
but they've got some strength and it was a good examination around the ball for the Western

33:17.420 --> 33:17.950
bulldogs.

33:17.950 --> 33:18.460
But again,

33:18.470 --> 33:18.910
you know,

33:19.220 --> 33:23.780
you said before the game started that the kangaroos would have to kick

33:23.790 --> 33:28.140
over 100 points And you were nearly on the money,

33:28.140 --> 33:29.810
108 points in total.

33:29.810 --> 33:30.590
16 goals,

33:30.600 --> 33:30.960
12.

33:30.960 --> 33:35.940
It's a good return by the Bulldogs who have a big negative with Aaron Norton going

33:35.940 --> 33:39.260
down with the big load of this gone after a huge leap,

33:40.340 --> 33:41.510
but an entertaining gun.

33:41.510 --> 33:43.060
They both play good footage.

33:44.930 --> 33:46.270
It's Wallace gets his three.

33:48.140 --> 33:50.440
But in many ways the start of the game,

33:50.450 --> 33:54.090
I think gave us the story of the day and that was Cody Wightman.

33:54.800 --> 33:55.840
It was his first quarter,

33:55.840 --> 34:00.240
was sensational and really did start to set up the way the bulldogs played

34:00.240 --> 34:04.930
throughout throughout the afternoon with good energy and

34:04.940 --> 34:06.600
mitch Wallis had a good last quarter,

34:06.600 --> 34:09.980
so helped his cause is in terms of that.

34:09.980 --> 34:14.260
But the middle part of the game is what allowed the bulldogs to jump on top.
